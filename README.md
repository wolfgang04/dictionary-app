# Dictionary-app

Dictionary-app is a simple web application that allows users to search a word and displays its definition and pronounciation. The app
uses [dictionarydev's API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to fetch the word definitions.
Dictionary-app is made using this [api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)

## Installation

To install and run the app, follow these steps:
* Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
* Run the following command to install the dependencies ` npm install `

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:
* After installing, run `npm run start` to run it on your local machine
* Type the word you want to search for in the search bar and press Enter
* If the word you're looking for exists, the app will display the word and under it will be its phonetics and on the side is a button for its pronounciation
* Otherwise, the app will tell you that the word you're looking for doesn't exist

Note that the app is designed for the english lexicon only and does not support searching for multiple words or phrases
